# Testing

We follow a rigorous testing standard for our code base and Module Library, including:

**Unit Testing:** Each component of the Inverter Protocol undergoes rigorous testing to ensure it functions as intended in isolation.

**Integration Testing:** This testing ensures that modules work harmoniously when integrated into the protocol architecture and interact with other modules.

**End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** E2E testing evaluates the system as a whole. We simulate real-world scenarios and user interactions from the ground up until the end of the lifecycle.

**User Testing:** User testing exposes the system to real prospective users in an on-chain testnet environment with a basic UI prototype.

**Other Approaches in Testing:** We apply advanced testing methods where relevant, which might include fuzz testing for uncovering vulnerabilities through random inputs, invariant testing to ensure system stability, code coverage analysis for comprehensive test coverage, and static analysis for early vulnerability detection.

**Learning from the Past:** Testing Against Previous Hacks: We actively learn from historical vulnerabilities by analyzing and simulating past breaches, ensuring our protocol is safeguarded against known threats.

In essence, testing at Inverter Protocol is not a mere procedural step but a holistic strategy. By combining traditional testing methods with innovative approaches and learning from historical vulnerabilities, we ensure a robust, reliable, and resilient protocol for our users.

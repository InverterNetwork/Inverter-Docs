# About Funding Manager Modules

Funding Manager modules are primary issuance markets that process fund inflows into the workflow and dynamic token issuance against a collateral.
Primary issuance markets allow for the exchange of an asset at its origination point, where it is minted, with its price and supply, therefore, providing a dynamic minting and redeeming logic. These range from protocol-owned Automated Market Makers (poAMM) to auction mechanisms that have varying ways to dynamically regulate the price and supply of assets. The issuance workflow of an asset may also start off-chain, after which it is minted on-chain. Funding Manager can support different ways of integrating verifiable data into its issuance logic.

With primary issuance markets, Inverter Network aims to enable the origination of an asset or credit and expand services toward its distribution, circulation, and governance with Inverter workflows. For example, a bonding curve can power the issuance of a community currency with a backing that is used in real-world payments among local businesses, and the treasury generated from the minting and redeeming volume fees is governed by the relevant stakeholders as a common spending budget. Or, primary issuance markets can facilitate the tokenization of invoice obligations between SMEs to generate a credit token that can be spent between each other with conditioned burn logic based on the expiry of the invoice upon its payment or credit clearing algorithms.

# What is Inverter Network

Inverter Network is a modular infrastructure for system design & protocol development. With a vision to simplify building on the blockchain, it offers the Inverter Open Library of Modules; reusable, upgradable, tested & audited repository of stand-alone smart contracts; that can be customized and composed into protocols and mechanisms. Its core operator contract, the Orchestrator, acts as the interoperability layer and connects enabled modules for managing asset flows, authorizations, and other logic functionalities. With this design, projects can immediately adapt and modify functionalities without additional development and auditing costs.

# Mission and Vision

Our long-term vision is to position Inverter as a blockchain protocol standard with a future-proof architecture to provide a reliable design space to any type of organization for configuring blockchain solutions to their real-world pain points. We hope to build a thriving Open Library of Modules, maintained by a community, that serves as the foundation for interoperable solutions. To bring this vision to life, we're developing the Inverter Control Room, an interactive low-code interface, where users can effortlessly select, simulate, and deploy modules to design workflows within a month. As projects deploy on the Inverter architecture, they can also contribute to the Open Library, further enriching it. This will foster an interconnected Inverter ecosystem where every protocol shares a compatible architecture, mutually benefiting from each another's innovation.

# Modular Infrastructure

Inverter Network is built on a foundation of modular infrastructure. This design choice emphasizes the use of standalone smart contracts that are easily customizable and can be integrated into broader protocols and mechanisms, offering scalability and adaptability.

# The Orchestrator

The Orchestrator is essential for the protocol, acting as the interoperability layer that connects different modules. It manages asset flows, authorizations, and the execution of logic functionalities, enhancing the protocol's flexibility and operational efficiency.


# Inverter Open Library of Modules

At the core of Inverter's ecosystem is the Open Library of Modules, a repository of smart contracts that are reusable, upgradable, and have been thoroughly tested. This library serves as a crucial resource for building interoperable solutions and is maintained by a community committed to the protocolâ€™s growth and innovation.

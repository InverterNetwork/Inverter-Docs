# Use Cases

Inverter workflows can enable a wide variety of use cases between multiple stakeholders, from conditioned payment streams to dynamic staking mechanisms, from investable workstreams to fully-fledged protocols, and many more novel use cases Inverter will unlock with its technology partners.

We will announce the first cohort of applications that will be integrating Inverter, which ranges across verticals funding platforms, to DID issuance and impact accreditation, IP-NFTs, and novel staking contracts.

Here is a simple use-case scenario for how Inverter can provide a project with extendable workflow capabilities.

**Bob wants to build a contributor management platform for organizations.**

# This platform needs to:

Manage tasks & accommodate assignments

Monitor & evaluate deadlines and milestones

Condition the payout structure based on contributor performance

Execute & streamline the payment

This specific user journey needs to consist of the following Inverter Open Library Modules with the below-mentioned functions to create the desired workflow.

# Inverter Open Library Modules

**Role Authorizer Module** - Authorizes payments and permissions for different stakeholder roles.

Using this module, funders can create and modify milestones, and validate milestones from contributors. Contributors have permission to start a milestone and submit deliverables.

**Custom Payout Milestone Module** - Creates different types of payment orders and milestones, with customizable parameters for milestone duration, total budget, and payout structure.

Funds flow to the contributors on a milestone basis. The payout structure with the milestone, such as the percentage paid out at the initiation of a milestone, during a milestone, and at the completion of a milestone can be customized.

**Streaming Module** - Handles the processing of payments to the contributors.

In this use case, funds are streamed to contributors. The payment logic can also be customized for a specific need, or integrate a variety of existing streaming solutions.

By implementing this workflow, Bobâ€™s contributor management platform can now allow its users to set up tasks and delivery-based agreements with service providers, contributors, or community members, attach payments based on the condition of agreed-upon deliverables, and process the payments according to a custom schedule that can extend from the beginning of work to its completion. All of these processes will be streamlined through smart contracts.

# Audits

Audits serve as a critical checkpoint for blockchain projects, providing external validation of the protocol's security and functionality. At Inverter Protocol, we view audits not as a mere formality but as an essential component of our commitment to transparency and security.

**Multilayered Audit Approach:** Recognizing the diverse nature of potential vulnerabilities, we employ a multi-layered audit strategy that starts with engaging professional auditing firms and solo researchers to regularly review our code, then hosting regular public audit competitions tap into the collective wisdom of the community, and having a continuous bug bounty pool offer a clear path for whitehats to report discovered vulnerabilities.

**Continuous Auditing:** Code security is not a one-time achievement but an ongoing endeavor. As such, we subject our code to a continuous auditing system:

    - **In-development review:** Early bug detection through regular security reviews with our auditing partners, including Team Omega and Rahul Saxena, security researcher at ZKsync.

    - **Pre-release audit:** Comprehensive auditing before any deployment, including a public audit competition. Inverter will have 0xMacro auditing its smart contracts for mainnet launch. In addition, Inverter will host a +$100,000 USD public audit competition.

    - **Periodic and Post-Update Audits** We schedule regular audits to maintain security integrity as the protocol evolves with every new module, significant updates (major version), or additions to the core protocol.

By embracing a comprehensive, multi-layered, and continuous audit strategy, we seek to ensure that our protocol stands up to the highest standards of security and reliability in the Ethereum ecosystem.

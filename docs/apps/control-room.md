# Control Room Manual
### Introduction

The Control Room is designed to facilitate the development, deployment, and management of blockchain-native projects with a focus on token economies. It simplifies the creation and operation of these economies, making it straightforward, cost-effective, and secure for developers and web3 natives.

# Getting Started

###Â Using the Control Room

The Control Room's user interface is designed to be intuitive, supporting users through each step of the process from module selection to deployment and operation of token economies.

### Deployment

**Module Selection** 
Access the Deployment page to choose from the main module types: Orchestrator, Authorizer, Funding, Logic, Payment, and ERC20.

Select a module type, then choose a specific module from the list provided, which includes icons, names, and short descriptions for guidance.

**Configuration**
After selecting a module, enter the initial configuration inputs as guided. Some modules, like the Bonding Curve Funding Manager, offer visual dashboards for easier configuration.

**Deployment**
Complete the configuration for at least one module of each type to enable the deployment option. Proceed with deployment once ready.

### Operation

**Module Management**
On the Operation page, you'll again see the main module types. After selecting a module type, its details will appear, including options for "Read" and "Write" operations.

**Read:** This section auto-displays results from endpoints not requiring inputs, or provides input fields for user submission to fetch data.

**Write:** Here, methods requiring user interaction are listed. Inputs should be in a human-readable format, and a wallet connector popup will appear for transaction submissions. The results or any error messages are displayed accordingly.

**History**
A floating button allows access to your history of method calls and transactions, along with associated metadata, from anywhere in the app.

### Tooltips and Guidance
Tooltips are available throughout the Read and Write sections, offering explanations on the use cases of methods, input structuring, and output interpretation.

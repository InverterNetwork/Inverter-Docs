# About Authorizer Modules

This module defines and enforces the permission structure of the system. It specifies the different stakeholder roles within the protocol and the actions each stakeholder is allowed to execute. Stakeholders can be users or other modules.

Authorizer module examples include role-based or token-gated permissions, on-chain voting, or simply integrating to an existing programmable account(s). Due to the upgradability of Inverter workflows without a need for re-deployment, projects can utilize Authorizer modules to introduce new governance mechanisms over time, and gradually involve token holders in the decision making of the tokenâ€™s parameters.
